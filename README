PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to provide the user the name of the most common color present in any jpg photo they want. 

FUNCTIONALITY
We import the 4 below to run the code
Requests: Allows us to make HTTP requests to thecolorapi.
PIL: Lets the code open and process our jpgs.
Counter: Gives us a convienent way to count the occurances of RGB values in the photo.
Matplotlib: Helps us create the visualizations.
To use the code, we just have to press run then type in the complete file name of the jpg we want to get color data about. The jpg must be saved into the cis3120-project folder. 

API - https://www.thecolorapi.com/
The API i used to do this is called thecolorapi. This API has a large database of colors, RGB codes, hexcodes, and much more. However one limitation of the project is that because there is such a large amount of colors/shades thecolorapi does not have every color in existance. To make up for this, the code will output the name of the color that is the colosest posible match to one that thecolorapi has in its database. Other additonal data the code will output includes the RGB and hex code of the color. 

VISUALIZATION
The code uses matplotlib for visualization.
First chart: A bar chart that shows the rbg units of the color. Each bar is colored in its respective unit to make it clearer.
Second chart: A bar chart that shows how the most common color looks like.
